# Installation and programming of a two-motor circuit
Welcome to the L298-Motor-Driver- wiki!
For this task, you will need an 
1. Arduino
2. two motors 
3. L298 H-bridge motor driver
First, the tensioner driver must be connected to the motors, then the battery must be connected to the motor driver, then the directive inputs must be connected to the Adrobno. There is an entrance to control the direction of the motors and another to send the electrical pulse to the motors.

The ports used are 10,11,5,6 and the ports 12,4 for the enable pin of the motors.
